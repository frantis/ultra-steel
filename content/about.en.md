Our experience is in research and development, we deal with custom products on a daily basis. We have a network of associates of related profession. We prefer a long-term B2B partnership but if you are looking for someone to 3D print 20 statuettes, to redesign your logo or to build a lobby kiosk, we can accommodate that as well.
