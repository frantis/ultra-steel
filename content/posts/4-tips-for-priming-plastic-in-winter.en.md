Priming sprays are essential tools for finishing plastic. They unify the surface and reveal imperfections. But they can be tricky to operate in winter weather. Here are four tips we learned by trial and error so you can avoid speckles and spots on your miniatures.



# 1. Keep an eye out for low humidity day

I hung a small analog hygrometer on my porch. I use it identify days with 60% humidity or lower. It is an inexpensive item that catches my eye every time I pass it. It is more accurate than data in weather apps. In my experience high humidity is the #1 culprit of bad coat of primer. Clumps and speckles form and it adds a texture defeating its purpose.

# 2. Keep the can warm

The temperature of the spray can is more important than the one of air. Rubbing it with your hands so it approaches your body temperature is good enough. If you don't feel like furiously rubbing the can, you can always put it in a pot of warm water. Avoid contact with anything extremely hot. (Hey, I warned ya)

# 3. Arrange the model so the details face you

I use a stick and putty tack or double sided tape to hold my models during spraying. As you want to spray away from your body, make it easier to aim the spray by placing the front side or top face (whichever applies) towards you. This sounds intuitive but may not be immediately obvious when arranging the models on the stick.

# 4. Finished? Clean the nozzle

There is a very simple trick that will ensure your nozzle is ready when you prime in the future. After you finish spraying, simply flip the can upside down and spray until only clear propellant comes out. Easy, right?

So these have been my tips for priming any plastic in winter. You can apply this to 3D printed objects, wargaming miniatures or model planes. For a more general introduction to priming, I recommend excellent video by Miniac over at YouTube. His tutorial series is concise and fun.
